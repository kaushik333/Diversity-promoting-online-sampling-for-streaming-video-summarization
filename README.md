# Diversity-promoting-online-sampling-for-streaming-video-summarization

The code is designed for 2 scenarios: 
1. using the VSUMM dataset
2. streaming from webcam

Note: This is only the implementation of the proposed method in the paper[1]. 

Dependencies: 
Python and OpenCV
OS: Ubuntu 16.04 (14.04 works too)

To install opencv download anaconda and create a virtual environment. Then you can either follow: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/10/24/ubuntu-16-04-how-to-install-opencv/

or just do (much easier) : 
source activate virtualEnvironmentName
pip install opencv-python  ---->  in the terminal (inside the virtual environment). 

Would recommend running it in Anaconda spyder editor
